Part of the "What I did in college series".  My friend and I were doing a little DJ work on campus.  We had 4 speakers, 2 computers and 2 receivers.  Problem was each receiver could only handle 2 speakers.  So what we did was create this program that synchronizes music over a LAN connection so that you can double your output power.  Has a small bug where the sound will get out of sync by a few milliseconds if the song is long.
